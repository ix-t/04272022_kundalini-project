        <h4>What is its purpose?</h4>
        <p2>
          Its purpose is to activate your Kundalini energy, or shakti. This is a
          spiritual energy that‚Äôs said to be located at the base of your spine.
          As Kundalini yoga awakens this energy, it‚Äôs supposed to enhance your
          awareness and help you move past your ego. Sometimes, the practice is
          also called ‚Äúyoga of awareness‚Äù.
